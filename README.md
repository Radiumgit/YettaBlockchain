This is the Yetta Blockchain placeholder

We are in a advanced discovery phase, where we are planning all the technology we will place in the final solution, and testing various existing tool for it.

We place in this repository what we are testing.

Yetta blockchain code will be then released in a different repo.

The actual candidates for the Yetta Blockchain are mainly 2:

Graphene, this is the framework Bitshares is build upon, it use DPOS, it implement multi asset and permit to implement sort of smart contract, our aim is to develop on top of it the Yetta Blockchain solution that is derived from DECODE solution.

The other Blockchain we are using is ChainSpace, that is the DECODE blockchain.
